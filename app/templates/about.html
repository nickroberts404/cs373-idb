							<td>I am a senior Computer Science student at UT Austin. Programming is something I'm rather passionate about, despite the fact thatI was only exposed to this
								discipline in college. I like to spend my time tinkering with C programming, which more often than not ends in frustration and failure. Another favorite
								pastime of mine is working on Bash scripts that end up taking more time and effort than just manually doing what I was originally intending to do.
								My strengths include C, Bash, and familiarity with Linux in general. My pet peeves (others might call them weaknesses) include poorly defined specs and
								protocols, reading code written in dynamically or weakly typed languages, and undefined behavior. I generally prefer working on back-end code, but I do
								have some experience with Javascript and client-side applications. This summer I will start working full-time at Amazon.</td>

									    Our data was scraped from http://gateway.marvel.com.
									  </p>

									  <p>
									    To use the API, Marvel uses an authentication scheme where credentials are passed as URL parameters. First, a developer must obtain a public/private key pair generated by Marvel. To make a request, a timestamp must be generated and passed as parameter "ts," the public key is passed as parameter "apikey," and an MD5 hash of the timestamp and public and private keys is passed as "hash." The authentication scheme exists to allow Marvel to regulate the number of API calls made by the entity possessing a particular key pair.
									  </p>

									  <p>
									    The purpose of the timestamp is to prevent a hypothetical attacker from copying a public key and hash combination and reusing the credentials. The addition of the timestamp means that the hash will change for each request. In practice, however, the timestamp can be any string and the Marvel API does not reject different requests made with the same timestamp, key, and hash combination.
									  </p>

									  <p>
									    For Phase 1, we just hacked together a bash script to get the JSON response and manually extracted the relevant data. We included this script in our GitHub repository.
									  </p>

									  <p>
									    For Phase 2, we developed a Python module, marvelpy, that uses the Python Requests library to make HTTP requests. marvelpy presents a simple set of functions to access API resources while taking care of the preparation and passing of credentials. Since Marvel only returns up to 100 resources (comics, characters, etc.) per call, an iterator construct was added to marvelpy to abstract away the housekeeping involved in making repeated requests.
									  </p>

									  <p>
									    Once scraped, the data from the JSON files was added to our database.
