I grew up in a suburb just North of Austin called Cedar Park. In my free time I climb and work on personal projects, and I'm excited to pursue these both after graduation!</td>

							<td>Despite that I dislike hot weather, I was born an Austinite. I attended Patton Elementary, Clint Small Middle School,
								and S. F. Austin High School. I was a member of Boy Scout Troop 448, in which I achieved Eagle Rank. My eagle project was
								to design and build a rainwater collection system for Clint Small Middle school. While in middle and early high school,
								I passed time by creating games on the RPG Maker 2000. I began experimenting with C++ in my late high school years before
								attending the University of Texas at Austin. My interests include intelligence, physics, and philosophy.</td>

							<td>
								I am a senior Computer Science student at UT Austin. Programming is something I'm rather passionate about, despite the fact thatI was only exposed
								to this discipline in college. I like to spend my time tinkering with C programming, which more often than not ends in frustration and failure. Another
								favorite pastime of mine is working on Bash scripts that end up taking more time and effort than just manually doing what I was originally intending to do.
								My strengths include C, Bash, and familiarity with Linux in general. My pet peeves (others might call them weaknesses) include poorly defined specs and
								protocols, reading code written in dynamically or weakly typed languages, and undefined behavior. I generally prefer working on back-end code, but I do
								have some experience with Javascript and client-side applications. This summer I will start working full-time at Amazon.

								I'm a senior studying mathematics and computer science. Prior to coming to the University of Texas, I was in the Navy
								for five years, stationed overseas in Japan and Qatar. I'm particularly interested in areas at the intersection of
								mathematics and computer science such as formal methods for software and hardware correctness and computational complexity.
